Therefore, the total amount of money he makes is:\n\\[\n13 \\times 15 = 195\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate how much money John spent on video games. He bought 8 video games at $20 each, so the total cost is:\n\\[\n8 \\times 20 = 160\n\\]\n\nWe know that after buying the video games, John still had $5 left over. Let\u2019s verify this by subtracting the total expenditure on video games from the total earnings from selling lego sets:\n\\[\n195 - 160 = 35\n\\]\nThis means John should have $35 remaining if there were no leftover. However, it was stated that he actually had $5 left. This discrepancy suggests a mistake in our interpretation or calculation; thus, rechecking:\n\nIf John indeed had $5 left after spending $160, then initially he must have had:\n\\[\n160 + 5 = 165\n\\]\n\nBut since he only earned $195, there seems to be an inconsistency unless additional context (like extra income) exists which isn't mentioned here. Assuming the problem statement is correct as given, we'll proceed with what's provided.\n\nGiven the information, John did not run out of lego sets during the transaction because he sold all 13 lego sets before making any purchases.

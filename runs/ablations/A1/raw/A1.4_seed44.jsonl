We need to determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born.\n\nFirst, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. Therefore, if we can find out how old Raymond is now, we can then calculate how many years ago his son was born by subtracting 23 from Raymeyard's current age.\n\nTo do this, let\u2019s consider the relationship betweenRaymond and Samantha:\n- Samantha is currently 31.\n- Since they are cousins, they were born within about 5 or 6 years of each other (this range depends on their ages when they became closest friends).\n\nGiven that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, it implies that he must have been at least around 23 years old as well because he would not be able to have children before reaching that age unless there was an earlier event in their lives.\n\nLet us assume that the difference in birth year between Samantha and her brother is less than 6 years since they are close enough to be considered siblings for practical purposes. \n\nIf Samantha is 31, and she has a child who is 23, then:\n\n\\[ \\text{Raymond's age} = 31 - 8 = 23 \\]\n\nThis calculation assumes that Samantha and her brother share similar family roots and thus should be approximately the same age given the short time frame.\n\nNow, knowing that Raymendard is 23, we can find out how long ago his son was born by calculating:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Years ago his son was born} = 23\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of years ago that Raymond\u2019s son was born is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).", "wall_time_s": 9.228612661361694, "peak_mem_gb": 3.239705088, "failure_mode": null, "total_steps": 4, "latent_steps": 4, "explicit_tokens": 0, "switches": 0, "stopped_reason": "converged", "top_k_mass": 1.0, "time_forward_s": 0.042658329010009766, "time_consensus_s": 0.07573294639587402, "time_comm_s": 0.0, "avg_bridge_rate": 0.0, "kv_stats": {"method": "none"}, "entropy_trace": [{"step": 0, "entropy": 0.427205890417099, "mode": "latent"}, {"step": 1, "entropy": 0.1225457489490509, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 2, "entropy": 0.10116380453109741, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 3, "entropy": 0.14658822119235992, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 4, "entropy": 0.0019924885127693415, "mode": "explicit"}], "drift_events": 1, "bytes_per_step": 400, "total_bytes": 1600}

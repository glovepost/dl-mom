Charlie can make 10 candles per pound of beeswax, and each candle sells for $2.00.\n\nFirstly, we need to determine the cost of making one candle:\n- Each pound of beeswax costs $10.00.\n- Since he makes 10 candles from one pound, the cost per candle is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Cost per candle} = \\frac{\\$10.00}{10 \\text{ candles}} = \\$1.00\n\\]\n\nNext, let's calculate his total revenue if he sells 20 candles at $2.00 each:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Revenue} = 20 \\text{ candles} \\times \\$2.00/\\text{candle} = \\$40.00\n\\]\n\nNow, we compute the total cost of producing 20 candles. Given that it costs him $1.00 per candle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total Cost} = 20 \\text{ candles} \\times \\$1.00/\\text{candle} = \\$20.00\n\\]\n\nTo find the net profit, subtract the total cost from the total revenue:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Total Revenue} - \\text{Total Cost} = \\$40.00 - \\$20.00 = \\$20.00\n\\]\n\nThus, Charlie\u2019s net profit after selling 20 candles is:\n\n\\boxed{20}", "wall_time_s": 7.963069438934326, "peak_mem_gb": 3.248607744, "failure_mode": null, "total_steps": 2, "latent_steps": 2, "explicit_tokens": 0, "switches": 0, "stopped_reason": "converged", "top_k_mass": 0.9921875, "time_forward_s": 0.02889871597290039, "time_consensus_s": 0.04438662528991699, "time_comm_s": 0.0, "avg_bridge_rate": 0.0, "kv_stats": {"method": "none"}, "entropy_trace": [{"step": 0, "entropy": 0.19981792569160461, "mode": "latent"}, {"step": 1, "entropy": 0.18098171055316925, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 2, "entropy": 0.0007489372510462999, "mode": "explicit"}], "drift_events": 0, "bytes_per_step": 400, "total_bytes": 800}

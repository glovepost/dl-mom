According to the problem, Jill works 50 weeks a year.\n\nNow, we can find out how many hours Jill works in one year by multiplying her weekly hours by the number of weeks she works:\n\n\\[\n50 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 50 \\text{ weeks/year} = 2500 \\text{ hours/year}\n\\]\n\nJill earns $20 per hour for her teaching work. Therefore, her annual income from teaching is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n2500 \\text{ hours/year} \\times \\$20/\\text{hour} = \\$50,000\n\\]\n\nAdditionally, Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach. Her annual income from being a coach is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n15 \\text{ hours/week} \\times 50 \\text{ weeks/year} = 750 \\text{ hours/year}\n\\]\n\\[\n750 \\text{ hours/year} \\times \\$30/\\text{hour} = \\$22,500\n\\]\n\nTo get Jill's total annual salary, we add both amounts together:\n\n\\[\n\\$50,000 + \\$22,500 = \\$72,500\n\\]\n\nThus, Jill's annual salary is \\(\\boxed{72500}\\).", "wall_time_s": 9.601221323013306, "peak_mem_gb": 3.242248704, "failure_mode": null, "total_steps": 4, "latent_steps": 4, "explicit_tokens": 0, "switches": 0, "stopped_reason": "converged", "top_k_mass": 1.0, "time_forward_s": 0.04253745079040527, "time_consensus_s": 0.07703375816345215, "time_comm_s": 0.0, "avg_bridge_rate": 0.0, "kv_stats": {"method": "none"}, "entropy_trace": [{"step": 0, "entropy": 0.1795436590909958, "mode": "latent"}, {"step": 1, "entropy": 0.1823265105485916, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 2, "entropy": 0.07894988358020782, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 3, "entropy": 0.07496318966150284, "mode": "explicit"}, {"step": 4, "entropy": 0.04104357212781906, "mode": "explicit"}], "drift_events": 1, "bytes_per_step": 400, "total_bytes": 1600}

We need to find out how much profit Josh made.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total cost of buying and repairing the house:\n\\[\n80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that the increased value is due to a 150% increase on the original purchase price (before repair costs). Let \\( V \\) be the initial value before any increases.\nThe new value after adding the repair cost can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\nV_{new} = V + 1.5V = 2.5V\n\\]\nWe are given that this final value equals the sum of the original purchase plus the repair costs:\n\\[\n2.5V = 130,000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( V \\), solve for it using algebraic manipulation:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{130,000}{2.5}\n\\]\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\nV = 52,000\n\\]\n\nSo, the original value of the house before any changes was $52,000. Now, we determine the profit by subtracting the total investment from the final value:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = V_{new} - (\\text{Purchase Price} + \\text{Repair Cost})\n\\]\nSubstitute known values:\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = 130,000 - 130,000 = 0\n\\]\n\nThus, there seems to have been an error since the profit should not be zero based on our calculations.
